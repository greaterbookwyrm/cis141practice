##1. Create a list of integers (you get to pick!). Write code to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of all even numbers. Print the resulting sum.
# I think this is right? I am not sure what "Iterate through the list" means? 
pi = [3,141,5,92,6,53,5,8,97,9,3,238,46,26,4,3,383,279,5,2,8,41,97,1] 
print(sum(pi))
